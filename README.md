# üåç Mazingira - Environmental Donation Platform

**Mazingira** is a full-stack donation platform designed to support environmental preservation organizations through regular and one-time donations. The platform connects donors with vetted organizations and simplifies the donation process, encouraging sustainable contributions to help combat environmental degradation.

## üß† Problem Statement

Environmental degradation is the deterioration of the Earth‚Äôs natural environment through the excessive consumption of resources such as air, water, and soil, the destruction of ecosystems, and the loss of wildlife. This leads to consequences that threaten the survival of humanity. Despite the urgency, there are currently limited resources available to fight this problem.

## üí° Solution

Mazingira offers a digital platform where:
- Donors can set up one-time or recurring (e.g. monthly) donations
- Organizations can showcase their impact and receive funds
- Administrators manage platform integrity and organization approvals

The goal is to automate and simplify the donation process to support the sustainability and growth of environmental conservation efforts.
